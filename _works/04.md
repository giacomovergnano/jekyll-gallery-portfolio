This year's OFFF Festival was on the same day of the [Irish abortion referendum](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/may/26/irish-abortion-referendum-result-count-begins-live) to repeal 8th amendment.   
The eighth amendment is a clause in the Irish constitution that recognises the equal right to life of both mother and unborn child, effectively prohibiting abortion in almost all cases.   
I have printed couple of hundreds postcards to allow non-irish supporters to write a symbolic "YES" and not leave Ireland alone in this important day.  
This is the coloured and dynamic result.

      <p>On 25 May 2018, the Irish people voted by 66.4% to remove the Eighth Amendment, choosing to replace it with the above text as a part of the Thirty-sixth Amendment to the Constitution, permitting the Oireachtas (parliament) to legislate for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.</p>
